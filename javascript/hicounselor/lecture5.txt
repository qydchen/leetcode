    - Amazon will administer in their onsite 50% behavioral and 50% leetcode for each round. There are 5 rounds.
    - Online assessment -> 2 problems, you need >80% test coverage to pass
    - Each round is about 45 mins -> 2.5 mins for intros, 20 mins for behavioral questions, 20 mins for leetcode, and 2.5 mins for Q&A

        - coding challenges
        - leetcode problems/hackerranks/codility
    - cultural fit
    - existing knowledge of the startup's tech stack
    - be prepared to do coding challenges. TYPICALLY, your interviewers will say "this will only take 2 hours to do". Be prepared to do it for 16 hours.

How to target for companies
    - For folks with no experience, DO NOT RELY on recruiters
    - Reach out directly to the engineering manager

Embedded Software Engineering
    - Be familiar with TCP/IP protocols, Linux programming, C

Random topics
    - When interviewing for technical rounds
        - Good behaviors
            - Be proactive on stating time/space complexity
