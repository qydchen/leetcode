// A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps,
// or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible n ways the child
// can run up the stairs.

// assumptions: if n is 0, then there is only one way a child can jump up the stairs

// if n is 4, then there are 7 ways the child can jump up the stairs
